                <p>Peter Parker (Earth-96283)
                    Peter's life changes forever while he is on a class field trip and is bitten by a genetically-enhanced spider that had escaped from its container. After that day, Peter begins to develop odd abilities, such as clinging to walls and shooting web-like material from his wrists. Portrayed by Tobey Maguire, he was the first successful Spider-Man on films.
                    This Spidey fought an alien on planet Earth.</p>

                <p>Peter Parker (Earth-120703)
                    Peter Parker is a vigilante superhero who was bitten by a genetically-altered spider, thus transforming him into a successful cross-species hybrid known as Spider-Man. He is the son of late scientist Richard Parker and his wife Mary Parker. Spider-Man battles many foes throughout the Amazing Spider-Man duology of films, such as Lizard, Electro, Rhino, and Green Goblin.
                    He was portrayed by Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man films.
                    Sadly, this Spidey never fought an alien.</p>
